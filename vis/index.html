    <h1>Memo on Trump’s linguistic effectiveness</h1>
    <p>From the word frequency analysis, all the frequent word are very simple and could be understood easily by all the publics. 
      Most words only have one syllable or two syllables, and most words have the concrete meaning or not that abstract, which is easier 
      to be understood and transferred.
    </p>
     <p>From the sentimental analysis, we could see, as the first two speeches are delivered by a special occasion like the election 
       victory speech or the nomination speech, they have more positive words. But towards to the normal speech delivered that not for 
       a specific occasion, the word Trump used are more negation. On the one hand, as the republican candidate, he of course will speak 
       a lot bad things that Democratic did before. On the other hand, he utilized the negative words to really show problems that existed
       or didn’t be addressed by the Democratic, and  the picture he represented is more closed to the publics’ suffering. 
       That’s the reason why people think he is more direct and brave to say anything without that much politician speaking styles, 
       and that’ s the style he adopted to make all his speeches expressive and accessible to all the publics.
    </p>
     <p>From the topics that got from the speech transcript, the most common word include american, country, nation, people, 
       which are common in the president speech. Except in all those speech, the common topic mentioned in the speeches also includes 
       immigration, job, law. If more speech transcripts added into the this text analysis, the topic analysis would be more 
       informative to explore more topics under the each speech.

     <P>For Trump ligustic strategy, based on the word list on frequency, the sentimental analysis, and the topic analysis, the Trump's ligustic
       strategies I found can be concluded below:
     </P>
     <P>In those graphs represented below, we could identify the most frequent topics appeared in Trump speeches, which are immigration, 
       law, criminal/security, tax, jobs,terrorism, economics, business, and trade. We also could grab some common Trump style 
       overstating words like greatest, big,great,strong, failed,incredible, unbelievable, fantastic, tough, and massive. For the people 
       he mentioned in his speeches, except the community, public, or American, he also mentioned workers, children, women and parents, 
       all of those play an important role in the society.

        For the distribution of those topics, as the speeches I collected are kind of varied, there are not that much overlap between 
       those topics. In my collected speeches, two of those are more like the announcement type victory speech, which will include more 
       broad, abstract, optimistic expression, the other two are more like the normal one to deliver his ideas towards some specific 
       issues, which are more specific, negative and detailed. That’s the reason why there is not that much correlation between those 
       topics.
